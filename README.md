Merge sort works

quick sort and heap sort currently do not

the .py program takes 1 command line argument of a number and generates a new file with the number of random numbers that is specified in the parameter, and also names the file accordingly.

the "Randomnm"#.txt files contain # number of random numbers between 1 and 50,000
